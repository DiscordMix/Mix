=== ISSUES ===

[FIXED] * Overloading arguments throws error.
    1) Execute command with extra arguments.

* Internal commands use auth for restricting, however owner auth (-1) does not work, it allows anyone to use them.

* Finish implementing/creating the new auth system. OR:
    *) Possibly the auth system is not really needed, it'll just create a mess.
        Instead of using a per-guild auth system ... what if? Haven't thought
        of an alternative, but I'm sure it's not really effective nor worth
        time investing.

* Check command's schema types when loading, as when executed the resolve function will throw error if a command has
    a type that is not either a string nor a primitive type.

* When primitive commands are removed from the consumer list, it will say "... enabled 5/6 commands" make it say
    "... enabled 5/6 commands (1 undesired)" instead.

* DM commands don't work, they throw 'name' error of undefined.

=== IDEAS ===

* Upon clicking on the OK command check, delete command + response
