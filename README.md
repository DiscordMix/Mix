Mix (previously known as Forge) is a powerful, modular and extensible Discord bot framework for serious bot development.

**Note**: Mix is a library to create bots and not a Discord API wrapper library.

**Note**: This project has not yet reached a stable point, and not all functionality will work as expected.

To install and create a template bot in seconds, issue the following commands:

$ mix new bot
$ cd bot

# Install node modules
$ npm install

#### Installing

To incorporate Mix into an existing project, simply issue the following command:

```ts
import {Bot, Util} from "d.mix";
```
