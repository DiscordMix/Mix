=== ISSUES ===

[FIXED] * Overloading arguments throws error.
    1) Execute command with extra arguments.

* Internal commands use auth for restricting, however owner auth (-1) does not work, it allows anyone to use them.

=== IDEAS ===

* Upon clicking on the OK command check, delete command + response
