=== ISSUES ===

[FIXED] * Overloading arguments throws error.
    1) Execute command with extra arguments.

* Internal commands use auth for restricting, however owner auth (-1) does not work, it allows anyone to use them.

* Finish implementing/creating the new auth system. OR:
    *) Possibly the auth system is not really needed, it'll just create a mess.
        Instead of using a per-guild auth system ... what if? Haven't thought
        of an alternative, but I'm sure it's not really effective nor worth
        time investing.

* Check command's schema types when loading, as when executed the resolve function will throw error if a command has
    a type that is not either a string nor a primitive type.

* When primitive commands are removed from the consumer list, it will say "... enabled 5/6 commands" make it say
    "... enabled 5/6 commands (1 undesired)" instead.

* DM commands don't work, they throw 'name' error of undefined.

* Invalid arguments message is not displayed when providing an invalid argument; Instead, max/min arg message is displayed.
    *) Example: whois 1234 => That command only accepts up to 1 and a minimum of 0 arguments.

* Executing plain command without required args throws "replace of undefined" error (ex. ".ban")

=== IDEAS ===

* "Undo" unduable actions (maybe an undo() method on commands?)

* NSFW Chat environment for command execution

* Upon clicking on the OK command check, delete command + response

* Ability to define command info (arguments, types, etc.) in XML (optionally)

* context.ok(<message>, <emoji?>)

* services + xml? Maybe define listeners, etc.?

* Log pipe, ex. this.log.error("testing") => [ServiceNameHere] testing, injecting the log pipe into commands + services.

* Use the really useful Readonly<> casting (it marks all properties readonly)

=== TODO ===

* Are invalid aliases names checked also?

* uptime Console command shows time capitalized

* Command switches need to be passed into the command executed() function in a similar form of args in order to access value, shorthand, etc.
