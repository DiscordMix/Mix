Forge is a powerful, fully-modular and self-contained framework for serious bot development.

**Note**: Forge is a library to create bot systems and not a Discord API library.

#### Quick Start with the CLI tool (recommended)

Get started quickly with your next Discord bot project by using our CLI tool!

To install and create a template bot in seconds issue the following commands:

`$ npm install --global @cloudrex/forge-cli`

`$ forge new bot`

`$ cd bot`

A bot boilerplate will be created under the `bot` directory.

You may then install required NPM modules (`npm install`) and copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` to configure your bot.

After you've provided your bot's token in the newly created `.env` file, you can start the bot:

`$ npm start`

That's it! You should be presented with the fancy Forge title and you're ready to get started!

#### Installing

To incorporate Forge into an existing project, simply issue the following command:

`$ npm install --save @cloudrex/forge`
