#### Quick Start

Get started quick with your next Discord bot project by using our CLI tool!

To install and create a template bot in seconds issue the following commands:

`$ npm install --global @cloudrex/forge-cli`

`$ forge new bot`

`$ cd bot`

Your bot will be created under the `bot` directory, you may now install required NPM modules and copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` to configure your bot.

After you've provided your bot's token in the newly created `.env` file, you may start the bot:

`$ npm start`

That's it! You should be presented with the fancy Forge title and you're ready to get started!
